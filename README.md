# Pokedex Single Page Webapp 
Limited to the first generation of pokemon, fetches from the https://pokeapi.co/ api then uses name, id, sprite, type, flavour text and renders for each pokemon.

Features & tech:
- user signup and login function with password encryption.
- login and store your favourite pokemon in the database
- api calls and object manipulation
- scalable rendering and information processing
-- if the api request was changed from 151 to 800 it would then display the other 650 pokemon, but this would impact load times and cause errors in processing images etc.
-- if desired the code can be changed to display even more information other than type, name, id and a flavour text, all that is required is to get the key from the object in the api and then process that information.

## Process and planning


Our wireframe planning; we initially wanted six favourite slots similar to a pokemon game but it would clutter the page and lead to many issues. Potentially fixable in the future
